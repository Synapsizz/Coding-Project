            <p>I bought my first Camaro at 17. It was graduation gift from my parents, where I paid for half of the car.  The Camaro has been my dream car ever since I was young and it is truly amazing that I get to experience this beautiful car so young. My Camaro has a red exterior with black leather as the interior. Under the hood is a 3.6L v6 pushing 323 hp and 278 pound-feet of torque.</p>
